Project Background & Problem Definition

Dataset Context
With the increasing integration of telematics systems into modern vehicles, vast amounts of data related to driver behavior have become accessible. This data includes variables such as speed, acceleration, braking intensity, turning patterns, and trip duration. The collection and analysis of such data hold significant potential, especially for the insurance industry.
Traditional insurance pricing models rely on general demographic and vehicle-related variables like driver age, gender, car brand, or engine size. In contrast, telematics data allows for personalized risk analysis and more equitable premium pricing.
By analyzing behavioral patterns, insurers can classify drivers based on risk profiles, enabling proactive claims management, pricing strategies, and customer segmentation. This project uses real-world telematics data from multiple drivers with the objective of classifying them into behavioral profiles and estimating their risk levels in advance.

Problem Statement
The core problem is to classify driver behaviors using telematics data and to analyze the potential risk levels. With the help of machine learning algorithms, drivers can be categorized into the following behavioral classes:

Aggressive Driver
Normal Driver
Reckless Driver
Defensive (Safe) Driver

As an advanced step, a "Risk Score" can be calculated based on these categories. Such a score could be leveraged by
insurers for policy pricing and risk strategy formulation.

Project Goals
Extract meaningful features from raw telematics data to classify driver behavior.
Evaluate risk levels based on driver types.
Propose a practical risk scoring approach for use in the insurance industry.
Note: The term "Telematics" is a combination of "telecommunication" and "informatics." It generally refers to the technology of collecting, transmitting, and analyzing real-time data from vehicles.

Exploratory Data Analysis
General Overview:
Number of rows: 1,048,564
Number of columns: 24
Memory usage: 192 MB (Large volume - requires efficient handling)
Missing values: Only 27 rows with missing data in x, y, z, mx, my, mz (~0.0025%) – can be safely dropped or imputed.

tripID, deviceID
Trip or driver identifiers
Useful for group-level analysis

timeStamp
Time info (object type)
Should be converted to datetime

accData
Acceleration data (likely string format)
Should be parsed for x, y, z values

gps_speed, speed
Two sources of speed data
Consistency check recommended

battery, cTemp, dtc, rpm, etc.
Vehicle sensor values
Great for feature engineering

x, y, z, mx, my, mz
Sensor/magnetic field axes
Can help infer aggressive behavior

Data Processing & Feature Engineering
Key Features for Behavioral Analysis

Feature
Meaning
Behavioral Insight

gps_speed
Actual vehicle speed
High speed may indicate aggression

acc_total
Total acceleration magnitude
Sudden moves/braking → risk indicator

rpm
Engine revolutions per minute
High RPM often linked to abrupt maneuvers

tPos / tAdv
Throttle/ignition timing
Can reflect aggressive driving

hour
Time of the drive
Nighttime trips often riskier

kpl
Fuel efficiency
Low efficiency may indicate harsh driving

x, y, z
Acceleration axes
Sudden shifts may indicate erratic behavior

About acc_total Feature:

This feature is computed as:
acc_total = √(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)

Where x, y, and z represent accelerometer data on three axes (forward/backward, lateral, and vertical movements). The magnitude gives a single value capturing overall vehicle movement intensity, often used to identify harsh braking, acceleration, or bumps.

Scientific Basis:
Newtonian Mechanics: Used to calculate total acceleration in physicsSource: Serway & Jewett – Physics for Scientists and Engineers

Telematics UBI Applications:
IEEE: "Driving Style Recognition using Telematics Data"

SwissRe, Cambridge Mobile Telematics Reports
"Acceleration magnitude √(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) used as a primary indicator of risky behavior."

Why It Matters:
Looking at x, y, or z alone is insufficient.
Events like sudden braking may affect multiple axes simultaneously.
acc_total provides a more holistic view of driving intensity.
