# driver-behavior-analysis-telematics
In today’s automotive industry, telematics systems integrated into vehicles provide detailed insights into driver behavior. These systems collect a wide range of data, including speed, acceleration, braking patterns, cornering, and trip duration.

While traditional insurance models typically calculate premiums based on general demographic and vehicle characteristics—such as driver age, gender, vehicle brand, and engine size—telematics data enables more personalized risk assessments and fairer pricing models.

By analyzing behavioral patterns, insurance providers can classify drivers based on their risk levels, contributing significantly to proactive claim management, dynamic pricing, and customer segmentation.

This project utilizes a real-world telematics dataset containing various driving behaviors from multiple drivers. The primary goal is to analyze the data to classify drivers into distinct behavior profiles and predict potential risk levels in advance.,
