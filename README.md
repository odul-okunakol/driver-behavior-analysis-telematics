# Driver Behavior Analysis with Telematics Data

## 1. Project Background & Problem Definition

### Dataset Context
With the increasing integration of **telematics systems** into modern vehicles, vast amounts of data related to **driver behavior** have become accessible. This data includes variables such as **speed**, **acceleration**, **braking intensity**, **turning patterns**, and **trip duration**.
The collection and analysis of such data hold **significant potential**, especially for the **insurance industry**.
Traditional insurance pricing models rely on general demographic and vehicle-related variables like **driver age**, **gender**, **car brand**, or **engine size**. In contrast, telematics data allows for **personalized risk analysis** and more **equitable premium pricing**.
By analyzing behavioral patterns, insurers can classify drivers based on **risk profiles**, enabling **proactive claims management**, **pricing strategies**, and **customer segmentation**.

### Problem Statement
The core problem is to classify driver behaviors using **telematics data** and to analyze potential **risk levels**. With the help of **machine learning algorithms**, drivers can be categorized into the following behavioral classes:
* üöó **Aggressive Driver**
* üöô **Normal Driver**
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Reckless Driver**
* üõ°Ô∏è **Defensive (Safe) Driver**

As an advanced step, a **"Risk Score"** can be calculated based on these categories. Such a score could be leveraged by insurers for **policy pricing** and **risk strategy formulation**.

## Project Goals
1. Extract **meaningful features** from raw telematics data to classify driver behavior.  
2. Evaluate **risk levels** based on driver types.  
3. Propose a **practical risk scoring** approach for use in the insurance industry.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
### General Overview:
* üìå Number of rows: **1,048,564**
* üìå Number of columns: **24**
* üìå Memory usage: **192 MB** (*Large volume - requires efficient handling*)
* üìå Missing values: **Only 27 rows** missing in `x`, `y`, `z`, `mx`, `my`, `mz` ‚Üí (~0.0025%) ‚Äì can be safely **dropped or imputed**

### Column Insights:
| **Column**                     | **Description**                   | **Notes**                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `tripID`, `deviceID`          | Trip or driver identifiers        | Useful for group-level analysis           |
| `timeStamp`                   | Time info (object type)           | Should be converted to datetime           |
| `accData`                     | Acceleration data (likely string) | Should be parsed for `x`, `y`, `z`        |
| `gps_speed`, `speed`          | Two sources of speed data         | Consistency check recommended             |
| `battery`, `cTemp`, `dtc`, `rpm`, etc. | Vehicle sensor values       | Great for feature engineering             |
| `x`, `y`, `z`, `mx`, `my`, `mz`        | Sensor/magnetic field axes  | Can help infer aggressive behavior        |

## 3. Data Processing & Feature Engineering
### Key Features for Behavioral Analysis
| **Feature**    | **Meaning**                   | **Behavioral Insight**                      |
|----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `gps_speed`    | Actual vehicle speed          | High speed may indicate aggression          |
| `acc_total`    | Total acceleration magnitude  | Sudden moves/braking ‚Üí risk indicator       |
| `rpm`          | Engine revolutions per minute | High RPM often linked to abrupt maneuvers   |
| `tPos`, `tAdv` | Throttle/Ignition timing      | Can reflect aggressive driving              |
| `hour`         | Time of the drive             | Nighttime trips often riskier               |
| `kpl`          | Fuel efficiency               | Low efficiency may indicate harsh driving   |
| `x`, `y`, `z`  | Acceleration axes             | Sudden shifts may indicate erratic behavior |

### About `acc_total` Feature:
This feature is computed using the following formula:
```python
acc_total = ‚àö(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)
